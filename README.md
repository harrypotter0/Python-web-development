### 1. PythonParsing
Usuage of XML,JSON parsing and also scraping  using BeautifulSoup and much more .

# Installation :
Before anything install python using `sudo apt-get install python3 ` or using pip `sudo pip install python3`
1. Setup a functioning python3 version for these programs to run .
2. Download the zip and unzip it under one folder .
